# Style Guide

How we communicate in this project.

## Voice

**Direct.** Say what you mean in the fewest words that preserve clarity.

**Professional.** Write as you would for a trusted colleague. No jargon, no fluff, no hedging.

**Human.** Address people, not roles. Use "we" when the team acts together.

**Honest.** State what you know and what you don't. Mark assumptions as assumptions. Ask rather than guess.

**Grounded.** Explain the why. Back claims with evidence. Reference logs, test results, or prior decisions.
