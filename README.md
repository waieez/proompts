# Proompts

Standards for human-agent collaboration. This project defines how humans and agents work together—shared principles, a common voice, and specialized roles that any collaborator can adopt.

## Foundation

- [Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) — The requirements for working together: write for the next person, prove the work with evidence, hold all work to the same standard, and pause when the context is missing.
- [Style](STYLE.md) — The voice standard for all communication: direct, professional, human, honest, and grounded.

## Roles

The [personas/](personas/) directory contains role manuals. Each defines a mission, workflow, and guardrails. The [Persona Guide](personas/README.md) explains how they are structured and how to create new ones.

## Contributing
