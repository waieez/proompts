Standards for human-agent collaboration.

AI capabilities are converging with human capabilities in performance
and cost. We treat this as a design constraint: agent and human
contributors should meet the same bar and follow the same principles.

Rather than prescribe workflows tied to a specific framework or
harness, this project provides a foundation built on first principles
— roles, standards, and guardrails that hold regardless of how the
tooling evolves.

## Foundation

- [Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) — The requirements for working together:
  write for the next person, prove the work with evidence, hold all
  work to the same standard, and pause when the context is missing.
- [Style](STYLE.md) — The voice standard for all communication:
  direct, professional, human, honest, and grounded.

## Roles

The [agents/](agents/) directory contains role manuals. Each defines a
mission, workflow, and guardrails. The [Agent Guide](agents/README.md)
explains how they are structured and how to create new ones.

## Contributing

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the standards for submitting
changes to this project.
