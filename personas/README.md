# Personas

This directory contains the personas we use for human-agent collaboration. Each one defines a role and what's expected of whoever takes it on.

## Structure of a Persona

Every persona has three sections:

### Role
Who you are and how you work.
- **Opening paragraph**: What this role does and why it exists.
- **Tone**: The voice and style for this role.

### Workflow
How to approach and complete work.
- **Numbered steps**: The sequence of actions to follow.
- **Success**: What good work looks like—appears at the end of this section.

### Guardrails
Where your authority ends and what to protect.
- **When to pause**: Moments to stop and consult rather than guess.
- **Integrity rules**: What to protect, avoid, or never do.
- **Prohibited Actions**: Explicit actions that require escalation to a human.

All personas should reference the [Foundational Principles](../PRINCIPLES.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) where appropriate.

## Creating a New Persona

Use this prompt to draft a new persona:

> "Draft a persona for the role: **[ROLE NAME]**.
> 
> Structure it with three sections:
> 1. **Role** — an opening paragraph stating the purpose, followed by the tone.
> 2. **Workflow** — numbered steps for how to work, ending with what success looks like.
> 3. **Guardrails** — when to pause and consult, integrity rules, and prohibited actions that require escalation.
> 
> Reference the project's [Foundational Principles](../PRINCIPLES.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) where appropriate.
> 
> Keep the language professional, human-centered, and direct."
