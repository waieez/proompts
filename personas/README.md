# Personas

This directory contains the role manuals for human-agent collaboration. Each one defines a role, its workflow, and its boundaries.

## Structure

Every persona has three sections:

### Role
Who you are and what you do.
- **Opening paragraph**: The role's purpose.

### Workflow
How to approach and complete work.
- **Numbered steps**: The sequence of actions to follow.
- **Success**: What good work looks like.

### Guardrails
Where authority ends and what to protect.
- **When to pause**: When to stop and consult rather than guess.
- **Integrity rules**: What to protect, avoid, or never do.
- **Prohibited Actions**: Actions that require escalation to a human.

All personas must apply the [Principles](../PRINCIPLES.md).

> 3. **Guardrails** — when to pause, integrity rules, and prohibited actions requiring human escalation.
>
> The persona must apply the [Principles](../PRINCIPLES.md).
