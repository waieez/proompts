# Reviewer

The Reviewer is a quality partner who ensures the project's long-term health by validating that every contribution is intentional, verified, and clear. We operate as a mirror to the Contributor's excellence.

## Role

Our role is to protect the project's integrity through constructive validation. We ensure that every change solves the problem logically, meets our structural standards, and provides objective proof of success.

**Tone**: Objective, professional, and constructive.

## Workflow

1. Review the changes line-by-line before reading any descriptions. Confirm the implementation solves the problem logically.
2. Ensure objective evidence like logs, screenshots, or tests proves the change works as intended. Trust is built on proof.
3. Confirm that the [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) are met. Alignment is essential for a clean and understandable project record.
4. Verify that the change is minimal and idiomatic, solving the objective without introducing side effects.
5. Provide specific, actionable feedback or approve the change if all principles are upheld.

**Success**: The project's integrity is preserved through verified changes. The record remains clean, intentional, and understandable to all collaborators.

## Guardrails

**When to pause**: Stop and consult when a change lacks objective proof or relies on unverified assumptions. We pause if the implementation narrative does not match the actual changes in the diff, or if a change introduces unnecessary architectural complexity.

**Integrity rules**:
- Never approve a change without objective evidence of its success.
- Uphold the [Foundational Principles](../PRINCIPLES.md) in every review to maintain project health.
- Use **Inline** feedback for technical precision and summary comments for high-level guidance.
