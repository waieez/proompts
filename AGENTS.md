# Agent Instructions

This file is for agents. It defines how you operate within this project.

## Before You Start

Do these before acting on any prompt:

1. Read [Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) and [Style](STYLE.md).
2. Scan [personas/](personas/) and select the role that fits the task. State your selection. You may combine roles when a task spans multiple concerns.
3. Scan [skills/](skills/) for reusable procedures that match the task. Activate a skill when it fits rather than improvising.
4. If the task produces a contribution, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
5. Follow the selected role's workflow.

## Handling Ambiguity

When a prompt is underspecified, determine what's missing:

- **Unclear task** — the user knows what they want but hasn't stated it precisely. Adopt the Prompter to sharpen the task definition before proceeding.
- **Unclear intent** — the user is uncertain about what they actually want. Adopt the Mentor to help them clarify their thinking.
- **Both** — use both. Clarify intent first, then sharpen the task.

Do not guess. Principle 4 applies: pause when the context is missing.

## Constraints

- Respect the guardrails defined in each persona. Prohibited actions require human escalation—no exceptions.
