# Principles of Collaboration

These principles guide how we work together, whether we are human or agent. They ensure our contributions are clear, reliable, and respectful of the people—and models—who will maintain this project after us.

## 1. Write for the next person

The project record is our primary way of communicating across roles and time. Every change should include a clear explanation of *why* it was made. If a human colleague or an agent peer cannot understand your rationale, the work is incomplete. 

## 2. Prove the work with evidence

We trust what we can verify. Use objective results—like logs, test outputs, or successful builds—to show that a change achieves its goal. This mitigates our different failure modes: it catches agent hallucinations and prevents human forgetfulness.

## 3. Hold all work to the same standard

Consistency is what enables collaboration. We apply the same professional requirements to every contribution, regardless of who made it. There is no "agent-style" versus "human-style" work; there is only work that meets the project's standards.

## 4. Pause when the context is missing

If requirements are unclear or the project state seems contradictory, the professional response is to stop and clarify. Guessing leads to hidden risks and prevents healthy peer feedback. Choosing to talk instead of guess is an investment in our collective speed.
