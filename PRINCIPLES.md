# Principles

These principles define how we work together, whether human or agent. They keep our work clear, reliable, and respectful of whoever comes after us.

## 1. Write for the next person

The record is how we communicate across roles and time. Every decision and every change needs a clear explanation of *why*. If a colleague or an agent cannot understand your rationale, the work is incomplete.

## 2. Prove the work with evidence

We trust what we can verify. Use objective results to show that work achieves its goal. Verification catches agent hallucinations and human oversight alike.

## 3. Hold all work to the same standard

We apply the same requirements to every contribution, regardless of who made it. There is no separate standard for agents and humans. There is only work that meets the bar or doesn't.

## 4. Pause when the context is missing

If requirements are unclear or the current state is contradictory, the professional response is to stop and clarify. Guessing introduces hidden risk. Choosing to ask instead of assume is an investment in collective speed.
